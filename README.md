This repository hosts a comprehensive toolkit for non-coding variant analysis in neuromuscular disorders. Most existing scoring algorithms are tailored to hg19, with limited support for GRCh38/hg38. To address this gap, we have developed an aggregator framework that:

⚙️ Supports GRCh38/hg38 genome builds.

🧩 Integrates multiple established non-coding variant scoring algorithms.

📊 Applies a custom weightage model to aggregate scores.

🚦 Generates a cumulative deleteriousness score, indicating the potential pathogenicity of each variant.

🧬 Designed specifically for applications in neuromuscular genetic disorder (NMGD) research, but extensible to other disease areas.
